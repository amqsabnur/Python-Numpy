How to get the necessary files to run this code? 
        Go to this website: https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Social-Services/DHS-Daily-Report/k46n-sa2m
           Click on the “Explore Data/View Data” button. 
           To keep the data set from being very large (and avoid some missing values in 2014),        
           filter the data to be all counts after January 1, 2020. 
           To do this:
              Click on the “Filter” button.
              On the menu that pops us, click on “Add a New Filter Condition”.
              Choose “Date of Census” but change the “is” to be “is after”.
              Click in the box below and a calendar will pop up. Highlight January 1, 2020.
              Click the check box to the left of the data.
           To download the file,
              Click on the “Export” button.
              Under “Download”, choose “CSV”.
              The download will begin automatically (files are usually stored in “Downloads” folder).
              Move your CSV file to the directory that you save your programs. 
              Open with Excel (or your favorite spreadsheet program) to make sure it downloaded correctly. 
              Look at the names of the columns since those will correspond to series we can plot.
